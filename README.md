# ESP-IDF Examples

Welcome to the ESP-IDF Examples repository! This repository contains a collection of example projects for the Espressif Internet Development Framework (ESP-IDF).

## Introduction

ESP-IDF is a free and open-source software development framework for the Espressif family of microcontrollers, which are commonly used in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The ESP-IDF provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for developing applications that run on these microcontrollers.

The examples in this repository demonstrate various functionalities and features of the ESP-IDF. Each project has its own directory within the repository and includes source code, build instructions, and any necessary configuration files.

## Examples

Here's a list of examples currently available in this repository:

- `wifi`: A simple example that demonstrates how to connect to a Wi-Fi network using the ESP-IDF Wi-Fi APIs.
- `bluetooth`: An example that demonstrates how to use the ESP-IDF Bluetooth APIs to create a simple Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripheral device.
- `spi`: An example that demonstrates how to use the ESP-IDF SPI driver to communicate with an SPI slave device.
- `i2c`: An example that demonstrates how to use the ESP-IDF I2C driver to communicate with an I2C slave device.
- `adc`: An example that demonstrates how to use the ESP-IDF ADC driver to read analog values from an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) connected to an ESP32 microcontroller.
- `ledc`: An example that demonstrates how to use the ESP-IDF LEDC driver to control the brightness of an LED using pulse width modulation (PWM).
- `http_server`: An example that demonstrates how to create a simple HTTP server using the ESP-IDF TCP/IP stack.

Each example has its own README file that provides detailed instructions on how to build and run the example.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, you will need to have the ESP-IDF installed on your development machine. You can download the ESP-IDF from the [Espressif website](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html).

Once you have the ESP-IDF installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the directory of the example you want to try.
