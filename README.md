# ESP-IDF Examples

Welcome to the ESP-IDF Examples repository! This repository contains a collection of example projects for the Espressif Internet Development Framework (ESP-IDF).

## Introduction

ESP-IDF is a free and open-source software development framework for the Espressif family of microcontrollers, which are commonly used in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The ESP-IDF provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for developing applications that run on these microcontrollers.

The examples in this repository demonstrate various functionalities and features of the ESP-IDF. Each project has its own directory within the repository and includes source code, build instructions, and any necessary configuration files.

## Examples

Here's a list of examples currently available in this repository:
